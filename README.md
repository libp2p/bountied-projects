## What is this? ❓

This repository tracks projects, initiatives and substantial chunks of
libp2p-related work that are – or may become – incentivized, for talented OSS
contributors to pick up and tackle.

Objects of bountying include: protocol implementation, tooling implementation,
research, testing, optimization, etc. They may target one or more libp2p
libraries, or they may be universal efforts to advance the entire ecosystem.

We track project proposals as GitHub issues. To make browsing easier, we
categorize issues on various axes through GitHub labels:

* Complexity: Low, Medium, Hard, Extreme.
* Status: Proposed, Funded, Delivered, Discarded.
* Readiness: Yes, No.
* Programming languages (e.g. Go, Rust, JS, Java, etc.)
* Topics (e.g. security, DHT, pubsub, etc.)
* Selected (e.g. for )

## Motivation 🎈

The libp2p networking stack is becoming a public good. Major large-scale
projects like ETH2, Filecoin, Polkadot, IPFS, Cosmos, etc. are adopting libp2p
as a foundation for their networking layers.

Collaboration in the p2p space is indispensable to build truly unstoppable,
future-proof p2p networks. All these projects share the motivation to propel
libp2p forward towards higher robustness, maturity, and feature richness.

This repo serves as the junction between those communities to propose,
enumerate, discuss, and agree on jointly funding crucial, substantial chunks of
work that, when addressed, would benefit various actors synergystically, or
even the entire ecosystem altogether.

Note: how bounties are actually allocated, contracts signed and payments
settled is out of the scope of this repo. This may happen through hackathons
(e.g. ETHBerlin), privately, or eventually via some kind of [Decentralized
Autonomous
Organization](https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1154529769276362752) (how
cool would that be 😎).

## Submitting a proposal 📝

This is all new and we're still figuring out the process and details. That
said, we generally expect things to go down like this:

1. Somebody submits a _Project proposal_ by filing an issue and filling out
   the lightweight template. The submission doesn't need to be perfect, we can
   sort out details later. At this stage, we want to keep the barrier to
   propose a project low.
2. The community reviews the proposal, enhances it, refines it, discusses it,
   etc. This is deliberately left unstructured, but we expect downstream
   project(s) to chime in to champion, and tentatively commit to fund XYZ
   amount towards the execution.
3. A senior libp2p community member comes along and fills in technical details
   to lock down scope, write up an actionable spec, and provide resources,
   guidance or references, in order to streamline the ramping up of the
   grantee.
4. The scoped & spec'ed proposal is once again reviewed by the community.
   Additional projects may chime in to co-fund.
5. Via the assigned off-band mechanism (hackathon, email, DAO), contributors
   signal interest, and co-funders communicate to select a grantee.
6. That grantee delivers the project.

## For developers 👾

Watch this repo to stay up to date with project proposals and to engage in the
discussion as potential grantees.
